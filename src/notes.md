# Object Oriented Programming

A way of solving problems by thinking about objects and how they interact with one another

There are 4 main parts to OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

* Class Declaration
* Field, Instance Variable Declaration
    * Declaring the data/attributes of an object
        * What an object is
    * All fields should be declared private
* Contructor(s)
    * Code to handle the creation of new objects
* Methods
    * The actions an object can take
    * Should write get/accessor and set/mutator methods for all fields
